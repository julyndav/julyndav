## About Me:
I specialize in bridging data analysis and business operations — redesigning workflows, building reporting systems, and improving data reliability so teams can make informed, practical decisions.

My experience spans healthcare, manufacturing, billing operations, HR analytics, and case-management systems, with a focus on process optimization, data governance, and real-world usability. I’ve worked extensively with operational stakeholders to streamline reporting, centralize fragmented data, and replace manual workflows with structured, maintainable systems.

In my current role, I support operational teams by improving data workflows, training staff on new systems, and ensuring accuracy and compliance in reporting for state and local agency partners. I enjoy solving practical data problems, untangling messy datasets, and translating business needs into analytical solutions that improve both efficiency and decision-making.
