### 👋 Hello! Data curious introvert here.

Embarking on this coding and tech-based journey, I'm dedicated to not just showcasing my successes, but embracing the power of learning through experimentation and the knowledge gained from my failures. Each challenge I encounter is an opportunity to evolve and become a stronger, more adaptable data analyst and tech enthusiast.

📊 Current projects that I'm working on involve delving into data to uncover disparities in health and prenatal care. I'm passionate about using data to drive positive change.

🚀 As a recent graduate of a Data Analyst bootcamp, I'm on a mission to empower non-profit organizations. My goal is to help them gain valuable insights and discover 
meaningful trends that enable them to better serve their communities.

📈 Let's connect and collaborate on projects that make a difference. Together, we can harness the power of data to create a positive impact.
